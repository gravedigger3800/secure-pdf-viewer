# SecureView PDF (MVP)

A Proof-of-Concept (POC) for a secure, ephemeral PDF sharing tool. This application allows users to generate time-limited, view-only links to PDF documents with built-in deterrents against downloading and printing.

## 🚀 Features

*   **Time-Limited Access**: Links expire automatically after 1 hour.
*   **Viewer Only**: No download button, print disabled (via CSS and JS), right-click disabled.
*   **Dynamic Watermarking**: Overlays timestamp and status on the document.
*   **Security Pause**: Blurs/Hides the document if the user switches tabs or takes focus away.
*   **Two Operation Modes**:
    1.  **Local Test (Browser Storage)**: Upload a file, saved to `localStorage`. Link works *only* on the host device.
    2.  **Public URL (Sharing)**: Wrap an external public URL (Dropbox/S3/Website). Link works for *anyone*.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

*   **Framework**: React 19 + TypeScript
*   **Build Tool**: Vite
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
*   **Icons**: Lucide React
*   **PDF Rendering**: React-PDF (PDF.js)
*   **Routing**: Hash-based routing (Client-side only)

## 💻 Local Development Setup

1.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Start Development Server**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Build for Production**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

## 📂 Project Structure

*   `src/components/AdminPanel.tsx`: The dashboard to upload files or input URLs to generate links.
*   `src/components/PdfViewer.tsx`: The secure viewing interface with watermarks and protection logic.
*   `src/utils/security.ts`: Hooks for disabling context menus and handling page visibility (tab switching).
*   `src/services/storageService.ts`: Handles the mock "database" using browser LocalStorage.

## ⚠️ Important Notes for Deployment

*   **No Backend**: This is a static Single Page Application (SPA).
*   **CORS**: When using "Public URL" mode, the server hosting the PDF must allow CORS requests (Access-Control-Allow-Origin) for the browser to render it in the canvas.
*   **Deployment**: This project is ready for **Netlify** or **Vercel**. Simply deploy the `dist` folder generated by `npm run build`.
